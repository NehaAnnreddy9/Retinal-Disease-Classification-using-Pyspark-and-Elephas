DESCRIPTION:
  The source dataset (available at https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/kermany2018) contains OCT (Optical Coherence Tomography) images that are used to detect diseases in the eye. The task here is to build a CNN model that would predict the disease when an OCT image is provided. To encorporate Keras with PySpark, the Elephas library is used.
